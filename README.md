# Versioning Goals

## Alpha (MVP, v0.1.0)

### Features
* Magic Link login system (password free, managed by JWT tokens)
* Submission Posting (with full Google Captcha v3 support)
* Submission Voting (upvotes/downvotes, options to sort by votes)
* User bio/birthday/full name customization on "account settings" page

### In Progress
* Command line logging (clean up what we currently have)
* Basic admin page (basic website metrics)
* Name change!

## Beta ("version two", v0.2.0)

### In Progress
* Comments (and comment threads)
* Ability to report a post (and maybe a user?)
* `.env` usage on the frontend
* Fully working admin page (view/delete flagged posts, delete users, view full website metrics)
* Clean up error handling (mostly using Log.fatal now, not great for production as this kills the program)

## To Do

- Modularize routes
- Improved error handling (ie. stop using `log.Fatal` and start using `fmt.Errorf`)
- New name

## Route Modularization File Structure

```
|--main.go
|--routes/
|    |--user.go
|    |--login.go
|--handlers/
|    |--user_handler.go
|    |--login_handler.go
```
